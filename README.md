## 🧠 How Does It Work?

- **Data Loading:** Automatically loads previous candidates and voters from `data.txt`.
- **Adding Candidates/Voters:** Enter info interactively. Each gets saved with a timestamp.
- **Casting Votes:** Each voter can vote for one candidate per position. Duplicate votes are blocked!
- **Results:** Calls are logged, and final tallies are displayed and saved.

---

## 🌈 Customization Ideas

- 🎨 **Make it pretty!** Add colors with `colorama` or emojis for more fun.
- 🔗 **Go online!** Convert to a web app with Flask or Django.
- 🗄️ **Use a database!** Switch to SQLite or MongoDB for big elections.
- 🛡️ **Add authentication!** Protect admin actions with passwords.
- ⏰ **Add voting deadlines!** No votes after the clock runs out.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations & Improvements

- Uses simple file-based storage (`data.txt`).  
- Not designed for concurrent users or massive elections.
- Consider using JSON for safer data serialization.
- Error handling could be improved for a smoother experience.
